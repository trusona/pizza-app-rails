# Pizza Builder App

We want to build a pizza from a list of ingredients.  The Pizza will have a name,
a description, and toppings.

Requirements
============

Please build a rails app that will meet the following acceptance criteria:

  * As a pizza app user, I should be able to list existing pizzas.
  * As a pizza app user, I should be able to create a new pizza.
  * As a pizza app user, I should be able to create toppings that can be added to a pizza.
  * As a pizza app user, I should be able to list the toppings I can to add to a pizza.
  * As a pizza app user, I should be able to add a topping to a pizza.
  * As a pizza app user, I should be able to list toppings on a pizza.
  
Additionally:

  * We expect TDD will be used.
  * We are looking for a function app, not necessarily a polished UI, so scaffolding is acceptable. 

**Once you have a app built, deploy the source somewhere online (e.g. Github) and send us the URL at
[devprojects@trusona.com](mailto:devprojects@trusona.com).**
